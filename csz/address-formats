Comma-based dilimiters:
	Requires at least 1 comma.
	Substr by commas, clear padding
	First section must be a number, such as 900. This is not flexable.
	Second section is a set of words, ending in some sort of street-suffix. I'm pulling it off Wikipedia.
	An optional third section can be used. It can either be a 5 digit number, which would be parsed to the zip code, a 2 character state abbreviation, a full state name, or a city name. State names and abbreviations will be enumerated, meaning if it is a character set, it should default to city unless the value is found in the state name/abbr enum arrays.
	An optional fourth section can be used, applying any of the above.
	Same for a fifth.
	I guess a US could be put in as well, but it would mostly be ignored since that's the scope of the project.

No comma: Space delimiter; First field = houseNo, other cat'd and called the street address
