 My First Azure Website

Requirements
Setup a Microsoft Azure Website by following the instructions in the "My First Website" video [Link].

Before you start the video, there are a couple of notes/suggestions:

    The video is produced at high resolution so depending on your screen resolution, you may need to scroll down to start or pause the video
    Similarly, it may be easier to see details in the video if it is displayed full screen
    Note that it is possible to utilize Windows drag-and-drop in Filezilla instead of the file selection method shown in the video
    Once you have completed the above video and setup "Hello World -HTML" on Azure, log back into your account and:
        Deploy your Project 1 to your Azure website
        Deploy your Week 3 Lab to your Azure website
        Deploy your Week 4 Lab to your Azure website
    Finally, create a visually appealing landing page called 'index.html' that provides visually appealing labels and links in the form:
        Project 1 - My Favorite Hobbie [link]
        Project 2 - First Azure Website Hello World [link]
        Week 3 Lab - ... [link] where "..." is the name of the lab
        Week 4 Lab - ... [link]
        etc.
